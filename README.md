# Data Analyst/Data Science projects and tools

Projects are organized by thematic folder.
My_tools folder contains my generic functions so I can use them when I need.

### Topics covered:

#### API and JSON: 
[SWAPI/Planet_population_distribution](https://github.com/javicebri/DataAnalysis-DataScience/tree/main/SWAPI/Planet_population_distribution): It asks for the data on the Star Wars planets in an open API and shows the population percentage of the 5 most inhabited planets and groups the rest as 'other' in a pie chart. 
___
#### Maximum likelihood estimation:
[Experiment_With_Exponential_and_Gamma_Distributions](https://github.com/javicebri/DataAnalysis-DataScience/tree/main/Experiment_With_Exponential_and_Gamma_Distributions): 
Own data experiment in which cars are counted on a highway to show that the time intervals follow an exponential / gamma distribution. For this, the parameters are obtained by maximum likelihood and a non-parametric test is performed (Kolmogorov-Smirnov)

[My_tools/maximum_likelihood_estimation.ipynb](https://github.com/javicebri/DataAnalysis-DataScience/tree/main/My_tools/Maximum_likelihood_estimation): Reference notebook to have the maximum likelihood calculation quickly.
___      
#### Nonparametric test:
[Experiment_With_Exponential_and_Gamma_Distributions](https://github.com/javicebri/DataAnalysis-DataScience/tree/main/Experiment_With_Exponential_and_Gamma_Distributions): 
Own data experiment in which cars are counted on a highway to show that the time intervals follow an exponential / gamma distribution. For this, the parameters are obtained by maximum likelihood and a non-parametric test is performed (Kolmogorov-Smirnov)

[Astronomy/Kepler/Star_mass_distribution](https://github.com/javicebri/DataAnalysis-DataScience/tree/main/Astronomy/Kepler/Star_mass_distribution): 
Exploration of data from the Kepler mission to search for exoplanets. He performs a study of the stellar mass distribution in stars with exoplanets and applies a nonparametric test (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) to rule out a normal distribution.
___      
#### Correlation:
[Astronomy/Kepler/Correlation_orbital_period](https://github.com/javicebri/DataAnalysis-DataScience/tree/main/Astronomy/Kepler/Star_mass_distribution): 
Exploration of data from the Kepler mission to search for exoplanets. Correlates the orbital period of exoplanets and searches with theoretical approximations.
