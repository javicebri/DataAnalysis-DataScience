# dataAnalysis
## Data Analyst/Data Science projects and tools

The projects are organized by thematic folder.
My_tools folder contains my generic functions so I can use them when I need them.

### Topics covered:

    API and JSON: 
      - [SWAPI/Planet_population_distribution](https://github.com/javicebri/DataAnalysis-DataScience/tree/main/SWAPI/Planet_population_distribution): It asks for the data on the Star Wars planets in an open API and shows the population percentage of the 5 most inhabited planets and groups the rest as 'other' in a pie chart. 
    
    Maximum likelihood estimation:

    Nonparametric test:
      - Experiment_With_Exponential_and_Gamma_Distributions/Real_experiment_counting_cars_Exponential_Gamma_MLikelihood_and_nonparametric_test.ipynb
